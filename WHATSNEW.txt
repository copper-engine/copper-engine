============
- New feature: Issue #61 Speed up PersistentLockManager - Attention! The interface and usage of PersistentLockManager has changed in this release! Also Oracle package "copper-body.sql" has changed.

COPPER 4.0.0
============
- New feature: Some extension in the JMX interface
- New feature: New method Workflow.savepoint() - Causes the engine to stop processing of this workflow instance and to enqueue it again. May be used in case of processor pool change or to create a 'savepoint' in a persistent engine.
- Bugfix:      Issue #53 Workflow.wait(..NO_TIMEOUT..) does not work for MySQL
- New feature: Apache Cassandra Support! Use a Cassandra NoSQL DB for persistence - this enables high available and scalable solutions
- New feature: New WorkflowRepository - ClasspathWorkflowRepository: Very easy to use but with less features in comparison to FileBasedWorkflowRepository
- New feature: Simplified creation of a persistent engine with CassandraEngineFactory and RdbmsEngineFactory - these factories do most of the work for you, creating and plugging everything together
- New feature: ProcessingEngine.run(...) now returns the wfInstanceId
- Maintenance: Now using ASM 5.0.4
- Info:        Java 6 no more supported (only 7 and 8)

COPPER 3.2.2

- gradle update (now using version 2.0)

COPPER 3.1.1
============
- Bugfix: COPPER doesn't work with MySQL with case-sensistive table names #42

COPPER 3.1
============
- New feature: PersistentLockManager - a service to obtain/manager persistent locks, e.g. to functionally synchronize workflow instances.
- New feature: PersistentProcessorPool.suspendDequeue/resumeDequeue  Suspends/resumes dequeuing of workflow instances from the storage.
- New feature: New utility org.copperengine.core.util.Backchannel, that offers functionality to signal a response from within a persistent workflow to its originator
- New feature: support for the H2 database
- New feature: added SimpleJmxExporter in copper-coreengine to ease the registering of JMX beans when COPPER runs without Spring
- Maven: copper-coreengine: moved dependency on C3P0 to copper-regtest. Removed *ConnectionCustomizer classes, because they broke the JDBC spec regarding autoCommit; also removed OracleConnectionTester as it can be substituted by setting 'preferredTestQuery="SELECT 1 FROM DUAL"' in C3P0 datasource.
- Maven: copper-coreengine: removed unnecessary dependencies on aopalliance, findbugs-annotations and commons-codec, so the only remaining dependencies are on ASM and slf4j-api

COPPER 3.0
==========
- no changes

COPPER 3.0-RC.5
===============
- New feature: COPPER now uses the Eclipse compiler ecj (or any other JSR-199 compatible java compiler) when found on the CLASSPATH and the default Java compiler is not available. Thus you can run COPPER on a normal JRE instead of a full JDK, ie. you no longer need to provide tools.jar as long as you add ecj.jar to your runtime dependencies.
- Bugfix: Issue #26: Removed commons-logging from dependencies
- Bugfix: Issue #25: Removed log4j dependency from copper-coreengine

COPPER 3.0-RC.4
===============
- interim release for build testing purposes only; nothing added or changed

COPPER 3.0-RC.3
===============
- interim release for build testing purposes only; nothing added or changed

COPPER 3.0-RC.2
===============
- First public release on Maven Central

COPPER 3.0-RC.1
===============
- Refactoring: Renamed COPPER major Throwable from "de.scoopgmbh.copper.InterruptException" to "org.copperengine.core.Interrupt". Persistent workflow instances and responses in existing databases keep compatible due to a loadtime adaptation feature - see StandardJavaSerializer.classnameReplacement
- Refactoring: COPPER's toplevel package has been renamed from "de.scoopgmbh.copper" to "org.copperengine". Persistent workflow instances and responses in existing databases keep compatible due to a loadtime adaptation feature - see StandardJavaSerializer.classnameReplacement
- Refactoring: All Spring supporting classes have been moved to an own subproject: copper-spring. Attention! SpringTransactionController and SpringTxnAuditTrail have been moved to another package
- Refactoring: de.scoopgmbh.copper.audit.BatchingAuditTrail does no longer implement spring's InitializingBean. This makes copper less dependent on spring stuff.
- Refactoring: de.scoopgmbh.copper.Response.internalProcessingTimeout changed from Integer to Long to enable really LONG timeouts
- Refactoring: Renamed table ADAPTERCALL to COP_ADAPTERCALL, renamed index IX_ADAPTERCALL to COP_IDX_ADAPTERCALL
- New feature: Added new wait methods, e.g. de.scoopgmbh.copper.Workflow.wait(WaitMode, long, TimeUnit, String...)

COPPER 2.4
==========
- New feature: engine.run throws DuplicateIdException if an existing workflow instance id is used - this is also implemented for the transient engine which substitutes throwing an IllegalStateException
- New feature: Default value for property "loadNonWorkflowClasses" in "FileBasedWorkflowRepository" changed from false to true, due to various problems, e.g. Switch-case not working out-of-the-box
- Bugfix: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and other exceptions during workflow instrumentation when extensively using nested blocks and local variables

COPPER 2.3
==========
- New feature: Extended JMX interface
- New feature: COPPER now allows for multipe responses for the same correlationId - see new method Workflow.getAndRemoveResponses(..)
- New feature: Custom persistence - persist application specific data in extra database tables and columns. This enables viewing (and modifying) data with standard SQL
- New feature: Monitoring GUI (beta)
- Maintenance: Now using ASM 4.1 
- Bugfix: Timeout signaled for missing responses in case of WaitMode.FIRST
- New feature: generic return value for RetryingTransaction

- New feature: Workflow classname in DB - for debugging/monitoring
- New feature: New property for DBStorage: staleResponseRemovalTimeout
